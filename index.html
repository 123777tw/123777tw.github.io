<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h1>你好世界</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>我被GitHub Pages托管。</p>

<p>上面是一个典型的调试页样例。但是它有些与众不同，它使用了多种语言。需要注意的是，英语总是最先被使用，因为这些文本直接引用自GitHub Pages的用英文写成的指南说明书。而之后出现的其他语言，是我们翻译过来的。如果您是一个精通翻译工作的贡献者，并且发现其中有翻译不妥的地方，尽管提出您的修改版本。</p>
<p>The above is a typical debugging page demo. But it's a little different as it's multilingual. It should be noted that English is always used first, because these texts are directly quoted from GitHub Pages guide manual written in English. And then there are other languages that we translated. If you are a good translator and find that there is something defective with translation, please feel free to propose a revised version.</p>
<p>与上面的样例不同，您正在阅读的这些内容最先使用的是中文。因为它是我写的，我更加擅长中文。同样地，如果您对其他语言的翻译有更好的见解（包括英语），随时提出您的修改版本。</p>
<p>Different from the above demo, the content you are reading is written in Chinese first. Because I wrote it, I am better at Chinese. Similarly, if you have a better understanding of translation in other languages (including English), feel free to put forward your revised version.</p>
<p>翻译成更多的语言，只是为了得到更多人的理解，而没有其他的原因。如果这里没有您熟悉的语言，很遗憾，是我们的能力不足。如果您愿意、并且有能力弥补这个遗憾，我们会非常高兴。同样地，我们的其他项目，也在致力于让更多的人理解。它不仅仅体现在更加详细的多语言注释，同时在设计上也会遵循<a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html">“最小功耗原则（the principle of Least Power）”</a>。</p>
<p>Translation into more languages, just to get more people's understanding, and there is no other reason. If you are not familiar with any language here, it is a pity that our ability is insufficient. If you are willing and able to make up for this regret, we will be very happy. Similarly, our other projects are also working to make more people understand. It is not only reflected in more detailed multi language annotations, but also follows <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html">"The Principle of Least Power"</a> in design.</p>
<p>也就是说，我们正在尽可能地降低我们的软件项目的参与门槛。一个大家几乎都了解的现象，就是有很多盈利性质的组织，在基于一些开放源代码的程序给予有偿服务，甚至即使有些开放源代码协议是苛刻的GPL。造成这一现象的一个最大的原因就是，对于某些人，即使拥有了所有的源代码，可能仍然不能理解它们所代表的含义。“自由软件基金会（Free Software Foundation）”从一个角度限制了自由软件的再垄断行为，但我们致力于从另外一个角度消除再垄断的意义，抑或是仅仅略微提高了再垄断的门槛。</p>
<p>That is to say, we are trying to reduce the threshold of our software project participation as much as possible. Almost everyone knows that there are many profitable organizations that offer paid services based on some open source programs, even though some open source licenses are harsh GPL. One of the biggest reasons for this phenomenon is that for some people, even if they have all the source code, they may still not understand what they mean. The "free software foundation" restricts the re-monopoly of free software from one point of view, but we are committed to eliminating the meaning of re-monopoly from another point of view, or only slightly raising the threshold of re-monopoly.</p>
<p>关于未来软件的发展，是开源更有力量，还是利益驱使更加有效，让我们拭目以待。<a href="https://github.com/123777tw/123777tw.github.io/discussions">讨论区</a>欢迎任何不同的观点。</p>
<p>As for the future development of software, whether open source is more powerful or profit driven is more effective remains to be seen. Any different point of view is welcome in <a href="https://github.com/123777tw/123777tw.github.io/discussions">Discussions<a>.</p>
